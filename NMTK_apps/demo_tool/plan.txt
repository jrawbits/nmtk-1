The demo tool should illustrate the following:

Minimal tool structure:
	Configuration file
	Basic documentation
	Sample data
	A grab-bag of configuration elements
	Perform a numeric calculation based on user choices
	Return two result files

Comment amply to explain what is going on at every step, including parameter documentation, helper functions and classes, etc.
